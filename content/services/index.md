## FAQ

### How do I find my co-op cycle?

Open the [Student Hub](https://me.northeastern.edu/), then

- Click "Resources" (top bar)
- Click "<Icon id="commentalt" className="inline" /> Academics, Classes & Registration"
- Click "Registrar Self Service"
- Click "Registration"
- Click "Patterns of Attendance"

Under the the **Patterns of Attendance** column, you should see your cycle. For example, "CO-OP S2/FL" means you're in the Summer 2 and Fall cycle.
